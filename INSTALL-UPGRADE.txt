Thank you for purchasing XenForo.

To install XenForo, you will need to extract the zip and upload all the files
from the contained upload directory onto your web server. You may upload into 
your web root, or any folder within the web root. This shall be referred to
as your XenForo Directory.

Having uploaded the necessary files, you should direct your web browser to the
URL that corresponds to your XenForo Directory and add '/install' to the address
(eg: http://www.example.com/xenforo/install). This will trigger the installation
process, which will guide you through the necessary steps to get a working XenForo
installation running on your server.

Please note that the installation routine will direct you to ensure that the data 
and internal_data directories within your XenForo Directory are writeable by the 
webserver (ie: chmod 0777).

UPGRADING XENFORO
-----------------

To upgrade an existing XenForo installation, you will need to extract the zip and
upload all files within the upload directory to your existing XenForo Directory,
overwriting all files.

Note that you should ensure that the data and internal_data directories remain
writable by the webserver (ie: chmod 0777). In most cases, they should remain writable
and you should not need to take action. You should always ensure that the contents of
the data and internal_data directories are maintained when upgrading.

Once the files are uploaded, your XenForo installation will automatically be closed
until the upgrade is complete. To begin the upgrade, go to the URL that corresponds
to <your XenForo Directory>/install (eg: http://www.example.com/xenforo/install).
You will be instructed to login as an administrator and guided through the steps.
Once the upgrade is complete, your XenForo installation will automatically be reopened.
